# Iris Classification ML Project

## Project Overview
This project explores the classic Iris datset uisng varoius classification algortihms. The goal is to compare different models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

It serves as a hands-on exercise to practice supervised learning, model evaluation, and exploratory data analysis using Python and `scikit-learn`


## Project Objectives
- Visualize and understand the structure of the dataset.
- Train and evaluate several classifiers including Logistic Regression, k-NN, SVM, Decision Trees, and ensemble methods.
- Apply feature scaling and dimensionality reduction.
- Use cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
- Gain experience applying theoretical ML knowledge to a real dataset.


 ## Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and training
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for reusable components
- `results/`: Outputs including figures and saved models
- `data/`: (Optional) CSV version of the Iris dataset

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Conclusion
At the end of the project, results are analyzed to determine the most effective model and identify potential areas for improvement.
