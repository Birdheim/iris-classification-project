# Iris Classification ML Project

## 📊 Project Overview
This project explores the classic Iris datset uisng varoius classification algortihms. The goal is to compare different models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

It serves as a hands-on exercise to practice supervised learning, model evaluation, and exploratory data analysis using Python and `scikit-learn`


## 🧠 Project Objectives
- Visualize and understand the structure of the dataset.
- Train and evaluate several classifiers including Logistic Regression, k-NN, SVM, Decision Trees, and ensemble methods.
- Apply feature scaling and dimensionality reduction.
- Use cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
- Gain experience applying theoretical ML knowledge to a real dataset.
